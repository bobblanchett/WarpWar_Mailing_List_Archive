# WarpWar_Mailing_List_Archive
This archive contains the  Messages, Files and Photos sections of the Yahoo! WarpWar Mailing List.

The Master copy of this archive will always be available at  https://github.com/bobblanchett/WarpWar_Mailing_List_Archive 

The [Yahoo Groups Warpwar mailing list](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/WarpWar/conversations/topics)  
The Point-in-time copy of the message corpus is in this archive and was also transferred to a Groups.io group given the increasing unreliability of the Yahoo Groups service,

The [Groups.io warpwar group](https://groups.io/g/warpwar/) has been established as a point-in-time copy of the Yahoo Group
A mbox archive of the transferred messages is in this repository.

A small low traffic [Google+ warpwar group](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106687884156103733179) has also been setup
