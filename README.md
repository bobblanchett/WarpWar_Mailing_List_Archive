The Yahoo mailing list is at https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/WarpWar/conversations/topics

The Point-in-time copy of the message corpus is in this archive and was also transferred to a Groups.io group given the increasing unreliability of the Yahoo Groups service,

The Groups.io warpwar group is at https://groups.io/g/warpwar/
A mbox archive of the transferred messages is in this repository.

A small low traffic Google+ warpwar group has also been setup at https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/106687884156103733179
