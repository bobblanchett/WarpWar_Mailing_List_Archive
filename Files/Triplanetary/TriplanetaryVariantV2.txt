1. ***BASIC RULES***
All basic Triplanetary movement and combat rules are in effect.  Exceptions
and additions are as noted in this variant.

2. ***EQUIPMENT***
An equipment and ship list is located at the end of this variant.  Any
other equipment not given on the list is considered to be installed or available
at no extra cost

3. ***START OF GAME***
Each player will start with 25 KC (KiloCredits).  After the sequence of
players is determined, each player may spend his money as he wishes.  All players
start at Ceres.  Any extra money may be left in a bank account on Ceres.

4. ***TURN SEQUENCE***
The turn sequence is the same as regular Triplanetary with all additional
activities occurring during the Resupply Phase.

5. ***PLAYER***
Each player (with the exception of the Space Patrol player) starts as the
captain of a single ship, then becomes the head of a corporation as his fortunes
grow.  Each player must have written down his location, whether travelling with a
ship, at a base, or on a planet.  If a ship is destroyed while a player is on it
the player is dead and his company dissolved itself.  More than one person may
act as a single player.

6. ***SPACE PATROL***
The Space Patrol player is the police/military arm of the Earth Government.
The Patrol player starts with 500 KC and collects 1/2 of all taxes and all the
fines that are levied against the other players.  The Patrol player may not mine
ore or engage in trade, but he may set up bases in the asteroids.  Patrol ships
must start on Luna and are crewed and equipped like all other ships.  He also
takes care of bookkeeping for the planets for ore and drug conversions.  The
game may be played without a Space Patrol player, but an active patrol improves
the game considerably.

7. ***CORPORATIONS***
Once a player has two or more ships, he must incorporate.  This can be done
at any planet and costs 5 KC and takes 5 days/turns of the player's time.  More
than one player may form a corporation together, but one player must be listed
as the head of the corporation.

8. ***OFFICES***
To keep the corporations bookkeeping and to direct its operations, it must
have at least one office.  Offices may be located on any planet or a base.  An
office costs 10 KC to set up and 5 KC every 30 days/turns to operate, with
operating expenses to be paid in advance.  If an office closes down, all
activities will not do anything further.  They will complete whatever activity is
in progress, then all functions stop.  To restart an office, it cost the same
as to start one initially.

9. ***COMBINING COMPANIES***
Companies may be bought outright by a player for an agreed on price.  This
sale is subject to the ten percent tax.  Mergers of corporations cost 1000 KC,
and take 120 days/turns to complete.  When corporations are merged, only one
player may be the head of the corporation.  Upon the death of that player, or
his retirement, the number two player in the corporation becomes its head.

10. ***SHIPS***
All the basic ships from Triplanetary are used, and also some newly designed
ships.  Commercial ships (those with a "D" combat strength) may transport any-
thing, but may not launch any type of an attack.  All other ships are capable of
using whatever weapons they can carry.

11. ***NEW SHIPS***
 A. **EXECUTIVE LINER**
 This ship may be used for fast transport of company officers or as a mobile
office.  As an office, it costs for both the ships and the offices operation,
and it must be supplied both for the crew and for the office staff.  3 units of
supply per month.  The office occupies twenty CP of cargo space in the liner.
 B. **SUNSHIP**
 A space sailing ship that uses the sun as its main power source.  It cannot
land on a planet.  When tacking with the solar winds it uses no fuel.  It can
freely move into any of the three hexes away from the sun as if it had used fuel
and the engines of the ship.  If a sun ship goes into or beyond the orbit of the
asteroid belt its sail will be ripped and no longer usable.
 C. **BUSSARD RAMSCOOP**
 This ship is used mainly for interstellar colonization.  Its scoop fields
sweep up minute particles of matter in space to fuel the engines of the ship.
The scoop is only usable after the ship is moving at a speed of six hexes or
more per turn.  When the scoop is in operation, it uses none of its regular
fuel.

12. ***BUILDING SHIPS***
Ships may be built on any major planet or moon.  It takes thirty days/turns
per attack factor to build a ship.  Ships must be paid for in advance and their
point of origin is recorded.  A mining base or recreation module takes thirty days/
turns to build and must be picked up from wherever it is built.

13. ***CREWS***
Crews are an essential part of most operations.  They man ships and bases and
mine ore.  The cost to hire a crew is two KC at hiring time and 0.1 KC for each
day they work.  Crews like to be paid at least once a month (30 days/turns), but
will wait as long as six months (180 days/turns) before they quit.  If they quit
the ships they are on will land at the nearest planet and mines and bases will
be open to anyone who will remove the crews to a planet.  If a player has crews
quit on him, it costs double for each new crew that is hired.  All new crews
must be picked up from a major planet or moon or Ceres.  A crew can be
discharged by paying them any back wages and two weeks (14 days/turns) severance
pay and leaving them at a planet, moon, or Ceres.  A crew can man both a mine
and a base on the same hex.  A crew by itself (no ship or base) has a defensive
factor of one.

14. ***SUPPLIES***
To maintain the existence of the players and the crews, supplies are 
needed.  One unit of supplies will fulfill the needs of one crew for one month.
At the beginning of the game, each players ship is supplied with three months (90
days/turns) of supplies.  Each ship has built into it room for three months of
supplies.  Extra supplies will have to be stored in the hold at one CP (Cargo
Point) per unit of supplies.  Once a crew runs out of supplies, they are dead
and all ship, base, mine functions stop.  A moving ship will continue at its
last course and speed.  Each ship carries two weeks (14 days/turns) of emergency
supplies.  Each base has one month (30 days/turns) of emergency supplies.
Replacement of emergency supplies cost 1 KC for ship supplies and 2 KC for base
supplies.  The Patrol levies a 10 KC fine for each day/turn of emergency
supplies used.  Crews on a planet do not need supplies.

15. ***FUEL***
Fuel for ships may be purchased on any planet for one KC per unit of fuel.
Fuel may be purchased and loaded while in orbit.  Fuel may be transferred between
ships and ships and bases as long as they are motionless to each other and in
the same hex.

16. ***RADIOS***
Ships and bases have built in radios.  Ship radios have a range of fifteen
hexes.  Bases have a range of twenty-five hexes, and planets have a range of fifty
hexes.  Asteroids and planets cause radio interference so one extra hex of
range is subtracted for each hex that type A radio messages travels through.

17. ***WEAPONS***
Ships and bases both use guns that are the same or similar to each other,
but only ships may use mines and torpedoes.  A crew has a defense factor of one
when they are not protected by a base or ship.  Any disabling or destruction
result will kill an unprotected crew.  The other weapons available to ships
besides their guns are:
  A. **MARK I MINE**
  Takes up 10 CP. Normal mine.
  B. **MARK II MINE**
  Takes up 5 CP. Smaller than Mark I, otherwise the same.
  C. **MARK I TORPEDO**
  Takes up 20 CP.  Fuel burns at launching.
  D. **MARK II TORPEDO**
  Takes up 10 CP.  Same as Mark I, only smaller.
  E. **MARK III TORPEDO**
  Takes up 10 CP.  Fuel can be used at any time.

18. ***TOWING***
One ship may tow another ship under the following conditions.  First, both
ships must be in the same hex and stationary in relation to each other.  Then
one day/turn must be used to rig towing equipment.  Double the normal amount
of fuel must be used to move the ships.  On the first turn of blasting, both ships
do nothing.  On the second turn both ships move as they would for one normal
turn of blasting.  The effect on movement occurs on the second turn it is done
and may be accumulated over a period of several turns.  Either ship may stop the
towing at any time.

19. ***BASES***
A base is a living quarters, defensive area, supply depot, and mining area.
A base has an attack/defense factor of two.  A base may hold an unlimited amount
of supplies of any type.  Base firing is done on the gun table.  A base has a
radar range of four hexes.  No landing may be made on an active base without
either the permission of the owner or the chance of destruction by the base's
guns.  A base may be located on any asteroid hex.  It does not need to be
located on a mine.  A base on a C-T mine must be equipped with pseudo-magnetic
grapples or it will suffer the same fate as a ship without such grapples.

20. ***RECREATIONAL MODULES***
Recreational modules are small additions to existing bases.  They provide the
little pleasures of life not usually found on an asteroid base.  If a crew has
access to a recreational module, on their base or on any of the six hexes adjacent
to them, they will spend one half of their pay at the recreation module.  This
does not apply to ship crews unless the ship is on the base for more than one
week (7 days/turns), and then only for the time spent at the base.  A recreational
module uses two CP of supplies per month.  If it runs out of supplies, it shuts
down until resupplied.

21. ***BASE TO BASE TRANSFER***
Men, equipment, ore, supplies, fuel, anything that may be transported inside
a ship may be transferred between adjacent bases at a rate of five CP per turn.

22. ***PLANETS***
At the start of the game, all planets are controlled by the Earth government
and each planet and moon shown on the map, with the exception of Jupiter, has
planetary defenses that are controlled by Earth.  The planetary defenses are
treated like ship guns for firing except that they always use the 2:1 firing
table.  Each planet that has full detector screens has six guns.  Mercury and Io
have guns only on the sides with bases.  Planetary guns can be neutralized by
nuking a side or by landing a warship of at least corsair size on that hexed.
Planets and moons will fire at any player who has declared himself to be a 
warlord or pirate.  Once a planet is under the control of a player, it will
fire only at his command.  A planet may be taken by another player by the same
methods unless there is a ship grounded on the hexside, then the ship must first
be destroyed by bombardment with guns from space.  A ship on the ground cannot
fire, it must depend upon planetary guns.

23. ***PROSPECTING***
All players start the game by prospecting the asteroids for high-grade ore
to sell at Ceres or some planet.  Only a transport or packet may search for ore.
The first ship to pass through a hex rolls one six-sided die.  A six indicates
high grade ore.  Only a ship moving at a speed of one may prospect.  All empty
hexes should be marked as such.  An asteroid hex may be reexamined once.  Roll
the die twice and if two sixes are rolled, there is high-grade ore there.  If a
one is rolled on the prospecting die, roll it again.  If another one is rolled,
the ship has found C-T (Contra-Terrene or Antimatter) ore, and is disabled for
four turns.  C-T may only be handled by a ship that has been equipped with pseudo
magnetic grapples.  Such a ship is not affected when passing through a C-T hex.
A base may be established on a C-T hex only if it is equipped with pseudo-mag-
netic grapples.  A crew also needs pseudo-magnetic grapples to work a C-T mine.
A regular mine produces one CP of ore per day/turn.  A C-T mine produces one CP of
C-T ore every five days/turn.  Any ship passing through a known C-T hex will
be affected by the C-T by being disabled for four days/turns.

24. ***MINING CLAIMS***
To make a claim the property of a player, it must be registered with an
Earth government office on any planet or Ceres.  A claim may be announced over
the radio giving that player the first chance to register it.  A claim must be
registered in person with a government office.  This takes one day/turn and the
cost is one KC per mine.

25. ***TRADE***
The game consists of the trade aspects of the corporations and their buying
and selling of various goods from raw ore to processed Cordrazine.  The trade
value table at the end of these rules lists the goods that may be bought and
sold and their basic prices.  The raw ore comes directly from the mining claims.
Ceres and Callisto are the only places that process the ore.  Ore may be
processed on Ceres or Callisto or a player may buy ore processing equipment.
Each ore processor converts four CP of raw ore into one CP of processed ore.
Each processor can handle twelve CP of raw ore per day/turn.  Ceres and Callisto
must have the raw ore to be processed before they can sell processed ore.
Ganymede produces two CP of raw Cordrazite per day/turn.  Earth can convert four
CP of Cordrazite into one CP of Cordrazine per day/turn.  Earth must have the
Cordrazite before it can convert it to Cordrazine.  Cordrazine is a medical
wonder drug that has very great curative and longevitive properties.  Ships must
land on a planet or moon to load or unload.

26. ***MARKET SATURATION***
Any market will become saturated after a load of cargo is sold.  This causes
the price for that type of good to drop.  A market will be saturated for one
day/turn for each ten CP of goods sold there.  A fifty CP load will saturate the
market for five days/turns.  There is a twenty five percent drop in price during
the saturation period.  This applies to any new ship brining that type of goods
on any day/turn after the first sale that has saturated the market.  Other goods
are not affected.  They start their own saturation.  Exceptions to this are raw
ore, Cordrazite and Cordrazine.

27. ***ORE PICK UP***
Ships may pick up ore at a base while moving at a speed of one.  Crews,
supplies, torpedoes, mines, and other portable equipment may also be picked up
or dropped off in this manner.  This cannot be done with fuel or C-T ore.

28. ***SPACE LINERS***
A player may choose to set up a space liner service during the game.  There
may be any number of different liner services operating during the game or at
any one time.  Once the first line is established, there must be a space line in
operation as long as there is a player loyal to the Earth government.  A player
may not be forced to start a space line.  Passengers take up two CP each.  Fares
are set by the Earth government.  Passengers will start to accumulate as soon as
some player announces that a line has been established.  The routes, fare, and
number of turns needed to accumulate a passenger for that run are given on the
space liner chart at the end of these rules. Note that corporations that
own space liner services have bonuses to their public relation.
(see 36. Criminal Acts and Trials, C. Public Relations)

29. ***TAXES***
The Earth government collects a ten percent tax on all sales of goods by
players at the time of sale.  This includes sales between players.  A property
tax is also collected every tax cycle or 360 days/turns.  It is ten percent of
the original price of all ships and bases including recreational modules.  This
also includes those ships and bases in the process of being built.  Not paying
taxes on time is considered a class one crime.  Any player not paying taxes for
two tax cycles automatically becomes a pirate.

30. ***BANKS***
There are banks on all planets that provide safe places for keeping money
and take care of transferring money between planets.  Branch banks may be set up
by a corporation for a 500 KC fee and supplying the branch with 5000 KC in
monetary reserves in the form of Plutonium (1 CP/100 KC) which must be shipped
from a regular bank to the branch before it can open.  Banks do not make loans.

31. ***LLOYDS OF LUNA***
Lloyds of Luna is an underwriting firm that will underwrite up to fifty 
percent of a cargo on a guaranteed profit basis.  They must receive full market
value for their share of the cargo to fulfill the contract.

32. ***INTERSTELLAR COLONIZATION***
A player may outfit an interstellar colonization attempt using Bussard
ramscoop ships.  Each attempt takes three Bussard ramscoops and costs 100,000 KC
and takes 360 days/turns to build and equip.  All attempts start on Luna and
leave the board past Jupiter, never to return to the game.
Note that interstellar colonization attempt give the outfitting corporation
a bonus to its public relations.
(See 36-Criminal Acts and Trials, C-Public Relations)

33. ***PIRACY***
A player may engage in piracy at any time.  If however, they are caught, the
corporation is declared pirate and all of its members are arrested whenever
possible by the Space Patrol.  The Free Port of Ceres is the only place that may
buy from or sell to a pirate.  Anything done to a pirate is considered a class 1
crime.  A player may declare himself a pirate.  Once turning pirate, a player
cannot return to his former legal status.  A pirate may become a warlord.

34. ***WARLORDS***
A player can decide that he has become powerful enough to challenge the Earth
government and carve out his own empire.  He then becomes a warlord.  Becoming
a warlord and the boundaries of the empire must be announced to all players.  A
warlord's empire may include any area he wishes and he may make any laws needed
to govern the area.  The warlord should make sure that he is powerful enough to
carry out his laws because otherwise the other players need not obey them.  A
warlord can only trade with Ceres, no other Earth held planet or moon will do so
and instead will attempt to destroy the warlord.  Once a warlord has declared
himself, it is the Space Patrol's job to destroy the warlord as soon as possible.
Other players may join in attacks on the warlord without fear of criminal
penalty.  Once a player becomes a warlord, he can never regain his former legal
status.  A warlord's empire may include planets, asteroids, and open space.  To
gain control of a claimed planet, the warlord must occupy it.

35. ***KIDNAPPING***
Kidnapping can happen only from a ship or a base, not a planet.  Players,
crews, or space liner passengers may be held for ransom.  The amount and other
details are to be determined by the kidnappers.  All actions involving the
victims and whatever ransom should be kept in writing to avoid problems and to
encourage honesty and doublecrossing.  This includes the killing of the victims.

36. ***CRIMINAL ACTS AND TRIALS***
There are certain acts that are considered crimes by the Earth government.
These are divided into three classes.  If one of these crimes is committed and
the Space Patrol is informed of it, the Patrol is required to seek out and
arrest both the crew (or crews) responsible and the head of their corporation.
Trials are conducted on Earth government held planets.  Guilt is determined by
the use of truth drugs and machines, but the result of the trial may be modified
by several factors.  These are the public relations value of the company and any
bribery the company wants to engage in.

A. **CRIMES**
   *CLASS I*
   Contract breaking
   Failure to pay tax on a sale
   Failure to pay tax for one tax cycle
   Uncrewed claim jumping
   Theft of stored ore or equipment
   Firing at a Space Patrol ship or base
   *CLASS II*
   Claim jumping of a crewed mine
   Piracy of bases or ships without loss of life
   Destruction of ships or bases
   Damaging a Patrol ship or base
   Abduction
   *CLASS III*
   Murder of crews
   Piracy with loss of life
   Kidnapping for ransom
   Destruction of Space Patrol ships, bases or crews

B. **TRIALS**
For each crime, check the appropriate column on the Trial Result Chart at
the end of the rules and roll one six-sided die to determine the result.  Start
at 0 and add the die result plus the public relations value and the bribery
value if any.  The final number is the result of the trial.

C. **PUBLIC RELATIONS**
Each corporation starts with a zero public relations value or index.  This
value can change throughout the game and should be kept current.

   *ADDITIONS TO PUBLIC RELATIONS VALUE*
   +1 - Heroism
   +5 - While running a space passenger line
   +2 - If company has recreational modules and is tried at Mars or beltward
   +1 - If running a service to other corporations
   +1 - For each trial result of "Suit Dismissed"
   +2 - For each trial result number of 21 or greater
   +1 - For each 5000 KC public relations program spent on Earth
   +5 - For each interstellar colonization attempt

   *SUBTRATIONS TO PUBLIC RELATIONS VALUE*
   -2 - If company has recreational modules and is tried on Earth or sunward
   -1 - If a company stops running a space passenger line
   -1 - For each trial result that is the maximum penalty
   -2 - For each trial result number of -21 or less
   -1 - For each failed bribery attempt
   -15 - For turning pirate
   -15 - For becoming a warlord

The players may agree to add or subtract public relations point given to a
player for actions during a game as long as all players agrees to the decision.

D. **BRIBERY**
A player may try to bribe the trial judges and jury to improve the result of
a trial.  For each trial, a player may attempt up to three bribes.  Each bribe
cost 500 KC.  For each bribe, roll one six-sided die, a score of 1, 2, or 3
indicates that the bribe was successful and a +1 is added to the trial result.
A score of 4, 5, or 6 indicates that the bribe was unsuccessful and a -1 is
added to the trial result.  All bribery attempts must be completed before the
trial die is rolled.

37. ***END OF GAME***
The game may be ended at any time agreeable to all the players.  It can be
after a certain number of turns, or after one player controls all the others, or
when one corporation has amassed a certain amount of wealth, or anything agreed
upon by all players before the game.  This is an open ended game and it can be a
long one, so setting some definite ending point is desirable.  If at some time
during the game, before the goal of the game is reached, further play becomes
meaningless, consider the game over and stop.
