This directory contains information on Microgame #4 WarpWar.  Almost all of 
this information exists today because of Evan M Corcoran's efforts in 
collecting the various bits of wisdom and rantings of many people. A special 
thanks for getting this started. Hopefully he'll be back on the Net one day.
