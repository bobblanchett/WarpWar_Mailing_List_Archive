Peterson   Even before IMPERIUM came out, I knew it was going to have some simi-larities to WarpWar.  Just how close these similarities would be, I was-n't to find out until a few weeks ago, when I received my copy ofIMPERIUM.  Before I proceed, let me go back and describe these two gamesbriefly:   WarpWar ($2.95 from Metagaming) is MicroGame No. 4, and follows thestandard MicroGame format.  The board is small, representing a sector ofonly 28 stars.  It is on the map that the first similarities between thetwo games become apparent.  Both games make use of pre-established'Warplines' by means of which instantaneous travel between linked starsis possible.  As to the rules, WarpWar uses a simplified economics sys-tem in order to allow players to design their own ships.  The board isused for only a small portion of the actual play, as combat is resolvedin a 'paper-and-pencil' manner using a straight comparison matrix (i.e.,given a set of circumstances, x, a given result, y, will *always* oc-cur).  Thus, the emphasis in WarpWar is on *tactics.*   IMPERIUM ($11.98 from Conflict Games) is a boxed game with a mountedboard and fully die-cut counters.  Ship types and starting forces arepre-determined, and combat is by die-roll (1-4 your ship is unaffected,and 5 or 6 it blows up).  The comparison has been made to a streamlinedversion of STELLAR CONQUEST, and it's apt.  Both the economics and thecombat lie somewhere between SC and WarpWar.  The primary emphasis ofIMPERIUM, however, is on *strategy.*  While the differences betweenWarpWar and IMPERIUM are many, these differences serve to make the twogames *complementary,* rather than opposed.  The rest of this articleshall deal with ways of bringing these two games together, as well asimproving each of them separately.  However, I would like to add thefollowing disclaimer: all of the following rules modifications are vari-ants, and have not undergone the same level of playtesting which theoriginal rules have undergone.  Use them at your own risk, but I don'tbelieve you'll have many problems.Variations on a theme: IMPERIUM   Before trying to integrate WarpWar's combat rules, I would like tosuggest the following optional system for determining the range inIMPERIUM's standard combat system.  1) Assign each ship type a Maneuverrating, as per table A.  2) Each side then rolls a die and notes thenumber.  3) As firing allocations are made, also determine the range.If both players agree as to what the range will be, that is the range,However, if disagreement exists, add the number of the die roll (2,above) to the respective ships' maneuver rating, and the player with thehighest total shall decide.  4) In case of a tie, the decision will bemade by die roll.  5) Apply the following modifiers: a) Subtract 2 fromthe M.R., if a ship is disrupted due to poor maintenance.  b) Add 3 tothe M.R., if the player decides in favor of long range, on the firstcombat round *only.*  Note: In battles where one side greatly outnumbersthe other, this system might entail some paperwork as both range andship allocation must be determined before combat can be resolved, andrange must be determined for each pair of ships, not just once per roundfor both sides.  I think that the increase in "accuracy" tends to offsetany such inconvenience, however.   As to playing IMPERIUM with the combat rules from WarpWar, there isno real problem.  Simply convert the ship counters in IMPERIUM toWarpWar statistics, use WarpWar rules during the Space Combat Subphases,IMPERIUM rules for everything else, and prepare for a very long game.For an example of WarpWar statistics for IMPERIUM ships, see Table B.WarpWar variations:   Again, I have some suggestions to improve WarpWar without necessarilycombining it with IMPERIUM.  The first of these is the concept ofReserve Power Allocation.  As orders are written, a player may allocatepower factors to his 'reserves'.  This power may then be added to thevarious ship systems to increase their effectiveness.  Reserve Power maynot be transferred to Beams or Tubes, nor to any system which does notalready have *some* power already allocated to it.  Power in reserves isreleased as follows: After combat tactics and weapons fire of each shipis known (i.e., Attack & fire beam, or Dodge & fire missiles) power maybe transferred to screens.  Note, that while this does not let you knowwhat your opponent's beam strength or drive allocation are, it does tellyou what's coming your way (if anything), including how many missiles.After this, both sides reveal beam strength, targets and drive alloca-tions of their missiles (beam targets are revealed before screens areincreased), and initial drive allocations for ships.  Any power remain-ing in reserve may be used to change that ship's drive setting, *eitherup or down.*  Combat is then resolved in the normal manner, using thealtered screen and drive values.  Obviously, this rule is intended pri-marily for advanced WarpWar players.  Other rule changes for the ad-vanced game are as follows: Technological levels are now more applicableto beams and screens, than before.  For every tech. level over '0', in-crease beam or screen effectiveness by 1/3.  Thus, a 5-point beam attech level 3 will do 10 points of damage, and a 7-point screen at techlevel 2 will absorb 35/3, or 12 points of damage (7 + 14/3 = 11 2/3 = 12rounded up).   Another way to add mystery to WarpWar is to use different types oftechnology; at the beginning of the game, each player decides whether touse the standard, beam, or missile technology pattern.  Standard patternuses normal WarpWar rules.  Beam pattern uses a screen that allows beamsto pass through both ways, and missiles neither (the screen can onlyprotect from missile damage).  Missile pattern allows the ship to stopbeam damage with screens, and fire missiles through screens (but notbeams).  Additionally, a player may reserve two technology levels anduse them to purchase screens that will allow fire of, and protectionfrom, either weapon type.  This is instead of the damage bonuses nor-mally allowed for those tech levels, and is expensive.   Playing WarpWar on the IMPERIUM board is, if anything, simpler thanusing WarpWar combat rules for IMPERIUM.  The Empire starts out withthree worlds and seven outposts, placed as per the rules to IMPERIUM.The Terrans get three worlds and three outposts, and both get ResourceUnits as per IMPERIUM.  R.U.'s may be used to purchase non-ship items atIMPERIUM prices, or ships at WarpWar prices.  Movement, combat and theturn-sequence are as for WarpWar (1 R.U. = 1 Build Pt.), and other rulesare determined as to whether the activity involves planetary interactionor not.  WarpWar counters should be used.   For a nice, short game, you can also play IMPERIUM on the WarpWarboard.  Count Mosul, Ur, Larsu, Nineveh, Ugarit & Babylon as homeworlds, all other stars as secondary systems.  Use the WarpWar Advancedscenario for resource units and victory conditions.  Player who getssecond choice of who moves first decides whether to use Imperial orTerran ships.  All other rules are as for IMPERIUM, except for GroundCombat (optional) and Imperial Intervention (deleted).                                 TABLE A     MANEUVER RATINGS                          SHIP TYPES          1 pt.
