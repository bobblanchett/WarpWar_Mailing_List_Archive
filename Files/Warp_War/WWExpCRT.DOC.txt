EXPLANATION OF COMBAT RESULTS

MISS: The MISS result means the weapons fired missed the target ship, and no damage was done.
ESCAPES: The ESCAPES result means that the ship that selected the RETREAT combat tactic successfully withdrew from its enemy and escaped.  In order to ESCAPE, a retreating ship must simultaneously obtain the ESCAPE result against EACH enemy ship (not Missile) that fired on it.
HIT: The HIT result means that the Beam or Missile or Shell(s) fired at the target hit it.  A Beam which hits does damage equivalent to the power of the Beam, plus tech level.  A Missile which hits does 2 hits damage, plus tech level.  Shellfire which hits does 1 hit of damage per Shell, plus tech level per burst.  "HIT +1" and "HIT +2" mean you add one and two hits, respectively, to the hits of damage inflicted by the weapon.

Results in (parentheses) are RECIPROCAL.  That is, if both ships use Beams and/or Cannons, only one intersection need be looked at to learn results for both ships.
