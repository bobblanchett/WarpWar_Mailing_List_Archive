WARPWAR RULE VARIANTS

This is a collection of variant rules for Microgame #4, WarpWar.  Some
of these rules are complex and change the nature of the game radically;
others fit smoothly with the original system.  To a degree they can be
mixed and matched with one another to produce a WarpWar of desired
simplicity.  Rules marked with a * are 'official' 2nd edition rules and
generally make no radical changes to the original system.

Many WarpWar enthusiasts have contributed to this article.  Thanks to
all of them!

SECTION I: SHIP COMPONENTS

*  CANNONS (C) are used by a ship to launch Shells.  Each Cannon may
fire either one, two or three Shells per combat round.  1 PD is required
to power a Cannon for one combat round.  Each Cannon costs 1 BP to
build.  Cannons are treated as Beams as far as combat goes, i.e. ship's
drive setting is used on CRT, but they may not be used with Beams or
Screens.  May be used with Missiles.

*  SHELLS (SH) are fired by Cannons.  Each Shell does a basic 1 point of
damage if it strikes.  Hit +1 and +2 and TL extra damage is added per
burst of Shells, not per individual Shell.  1 BP builds 6 shells.
Shells do not have a drive setting; they are unguided and act like Beams
in that they hit according to the ship's Drive and combat tactic.  In
other respects Shells are treated as Missiles - ship may be built to
carry any number (though they may never exceed the capacity they were
built with), and they may not be transferred between ships.  Shells are
not affected by ECM.

      EXAMPLE: S1 is TL:1 PD:5 C:2 SH:6.  In combat with W3 (TL=1), the
      orders are as follows:

      S1 ATTACK D=3 C=1 (fire 3 shells) C=1 (fire 1 shell)
      W2 ATTACK D=2

      Checking the CRT, S1 obtains a HIT +2 against W2 with both guns.
      First burst of 2 shells does [3 (shells) + 1 (tech level) + 2 (hit
      bonus)] = 6 points of damage.  Second burst does (1 + 1 + 2) = 4
      points damage.

*  ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES (E) allows a ship to alter the effective
Drive of incoming enemy Missiles and force them to miss or do less
damage.  ECM costs 1 BP per point. The ship can allocate PD to ECM in
combat, up to the ECM rating with which the ship was constructed.  In
combat, after orders are revealed, the player using ECM allocates his
ECM points among the attacking Missiles, and then adds or subtracts the
difference between the defending ship's tech level and each Missile's
tech level from the ECM points allocated to that Missile.

      EXAMPLE: W8 (TL2) generates 3 points of ECM.  2 Missiles are
      launched at W8: one at TL0 and D=2 and one at TL4 and D=3.  W8
      allocates 1 point of ECM against the first Missile and 2 points of
      ECM against the second.  Subtracting the first Missile's TL of 0
      from  W8's TL of 2 gives a +2, which is added to the 1 point of
      ECM allocated against the first Missile, totalling 3 effective
      points of ECM for that Missile ONLY.  W8 may alter the first
      Missile's Drive rating by 3 points in either direction - he
      chooses to reduce it to zero.  Subtracting the second Missile's TL
      of 4 from W8's TL of 2 gives a -2, which is subtracted from the 2
      points of ECM allocated against the second Missile, leaving zero
      effective points of ECM for the second Missile ONLY.

*  HOLDS (H) cost 1 BP per 10 BP capacity.  Holds contain BPs and allow
Warpships to transport BPs between stars.  When taking damage, 1 point
of damage will destroy one 10 BP-capacity Hold AND 10 cargo BP, or
fraction thereof.  When taking damage on a Warpship with more than one
Hold, the player may choose to damage empty Holds before BP-carrying
Holds.  BPs may be loaded or unloaded during the Build event only.  BPs
may not be transferred between ships.  Systemships may not have Holds.

*  ARMOR (A) is ablative hull reinforcement.  1 BP builds (2 + tech
level) points of Armor.  One point of Armor will absorb one point of
damage.  Armor is repaired at a cost of 1 BP per 2 points of Armor,
regardless of tech level.

      EXAMPLE: W6 is built at tech level 3.  2 BP are spent on Armor for
      for W6, building (2 x (2 + 3)) = 10 points of Armor.  Two turns
      later W6 is damaged and 4 points of Armor are destroyed.  The cost
      to repair W6's Armor from 6 to 10 points is 2 BP.

*  REPAIR BAYS (R) cost 5 BP.  A ship with a Repair Bay may use BPs in
Hold or from Star to repair itself or any number of other ships present
on the same star hex during the build/repair event.  BPs mined from
Baseless Stars may be used immediately to repair by ships with Repair
Bays.  Repair Bays like Warp Generators do not take damage in combat and
are destroyed when the Warp Generator is destroyed.

   SYSTEM DEFENSE BEAMS (SDB) are small Beam projectors built in a sys-
tem to serve as a last ditch line of defense.  They represent both plan-
etary emplacements and satellites.  System Defense Beams cost 2 BPs for
a one strength point unit.  (This reflects both the gun and the power
plant needed to operate it.  SDBs may be built only in one strength
point denominations.  It takes one missile or one beam hit to destroy a
SDB.  Any extra force is wasted.  (Attacking with one ship firing a beam
of 10 only destroys one SDB.  This is because of their physical separa-
tion.)  Each SDB must be attacked separately.  SDB's may combine attacks
on enemy ships in any desired combination.  SDB beams are assumed to
have a speed of one (1) when attacking; they use the attack tactic when
firing, and the retreat tactic when not firing.  SDBs may not be at-
tacked until they have fired or until all friendly ships have been de-
stroyed or have had their firepower destroyed.  Ships attacking SDBs
must use a drive setting of 3 or less due to the extremely small size of
the projectors.

   Energy gain from SDBs: SDBs may be fired singly or in any combination
at the owning player's ships, instead of firing at enemy ships.  Instead
of damaging the friendly ships, the energy is absorbed and added to the
current P/D allowance of the ship(s) so fired at.  It then acts in all
ways like energy generated by the ships' engines.  It is possible to
have a higher P/D thanthe ship was originally designed with.  This in no
way harms the ship.

   SYSTEM DEFENSE MISSILES (SDM) are self-contained Missiles and launch-
ers that are aimed and fired by onboard computers.  (They are a lot like
"brilliant pebbles").  SDMs are like spaceship launched missiles except
that their maximum speed is six (6) due to design considerations.  SDMs
cost 1 BP per 2 SDM for one BP.  This includes the cost of launching ap-
paratus.  Because of their small size and easy-to-hide characteristics,
SDMs may not be attacked by ships.

SDBs and SDMs are treated like normal Beams and Missiles when technology
increases.  All SDBs (but not SDMs) must be destroyed before system is
considered captured.  If there are SDMs left over at the end of combat
they are considered to be detected and eliminated.

   SPLIT DRIVE AND POWER PLANT (D,P) Replace the Power/Drive with:
Drive (D)  Denotes maximum speed of ship.
Power Plant (P)  Produces energy used for Drive and weapons.
Each point of Drive or Energy costs 1 BP.

   MARINES (MA) come in a self-contained shuttlecraft that is launched
from a Tube like a Missile and has its own Drive setting.  If it hits,
the platoon takes over the ship, unless there are Marines present on
board.  If this is the case, both platoons are eliminated.  If the
Marine craft misses, it must wait till combat ends to be picked up by a
friendly ship.  If friendlies lose, the craft is destroyed.  Marine
shuttles ignore Screens.  Ships captured by Marines are wholly owned by
the capturing player.  Captured ships may not participate in the combat
during which they were captured. Cost 1 BP.

SECTION II: MOVEMENT

"Movement Points" in this section are non-combat 'strategic' movement
points and do not alter normal combat rules.

*1. Movement points of Warpships equal one-half of PD rating, round up.

2. Warp generators cost 3 BP + maximum movement point value, e.g. to
build a warpship with 4 movement points, 7 BP must be spent
on the warp generator.

3. Warp generators produce (3 + Tech Level) Movement Points for non-
combat movement only.  Warpships may have more than one warp generator.

4  Tactical speed is goverened by a thrust/weight ratio: In combat,
tactical speed is determined by the following formula:

      THRUST=(6+Tech Level) x (D allocation)
      ---------------------------------------  =  SPEED
      WEIGHT=total number BP for construction

5. To travel n space (not warpline) hexes requires at least n squared
undamaged PD units.  For example, if in one turn a ship moves, 1 hex to
reach a star, then travels two warp line segments, and finally travels 2
more space hexes, it would require 11 PD = (1+1+1 space)^2 + 2 warpline.

SECTION III: ECONOMICS

* 1. Star Ownership:  A star is owned by a player if 1. there is a
friendly starbase and no enemy ships present or 2. there are friendly
ships and no enemy ships present.

* 2. Scrapping: Ships may be scrapped for 1/2 their current total BP
value.  Ships may only be scrapped at Bases during the Build event.

* 3.  BP Collection: Each Star has a basic BP value, determined before
play. A good range is 0-5.  During the Build event of a player's turn,
he collects BPs on all owned systems.  If a friendly Base is present,
the player collects double the BP value of that system and may stockpile
the BPs on that Base; if no Base is present, the basic BP value is
collected and the BPs must be immediately stored in a ship's Hold or
they are lost.  BPs may not be transferred between Stars except in
Holds; BPs may not be transferred between ships.

* 4. Bases: A Base costs 30 BP.  These BP need not all be spent in the
same turn, but they must be brought in Holds to the star on which the
Base is to be built.  A record must be kept of the progress of Base
construction on the star.  If an enemy ship is present unopposed at the
end of the enemy's turn on the star where there is an incomplete Base,
that Base is destroyed and all BPs spent are lost.  BP received from a
star may not be used to build a Base at that star in the turn they were
received.  A Base doubles the basic BP production of a system.  A Base
is destroyed automatically when enemy ships are present unopposed on the
Star hex at the end of the enemy's turn.  One half of all BPs present on
the destroyed Base can be immediately picked up by ships in the system
if they have sufficient Hold space.   Any BPs not immediately picked up
are lost.  Only one Base may be built on each star hex.

5.  This is the order of actions in the Build event, using the above
rules:

1. Build:
  (a) Receive new Build Points from owned stars according to the
      economics rules.  Add to stockpiles and record current base
      totals.  Load or unload system BPs into Holds.
  (b) Scrap old ships at bases and add Build Points to base stockpiles.
  (c) Build new ships and Bases, repair and resupply old ships.
      Subtract expenditures from Base totals  New ships are placed on
      the Star they were built at.

6. Colonies: A Colony is an upgraded Base.  A Base may be upgraded to a
Colony if 30 BP are spent at the Base; the BPs need not be spent all at
once, but they must be spent at that system, either from the system's
own production or from Holds of ships present.  A Colony quadruples the
basic BP production of a system.  Colonies may not be destroyed.  If a
player captures an enemy Colony, BP production is reduced to 2x basic
value. Colonies may be recaptured.  Optionally, Bases may be capable
only of repair and resupply, and stockpiling BPs, while Colonies are
able to build as well as repair, resupply and stockpile.

7. Half cost repairs:  Each BP spent on repairs rebuilds 2 points of
ship component.

8. Ordered ship design:  Ship attributes, excepting Warp Generators and
Repair Bays, must be arranged in order on the ship record sheet.
Attributes may be placed in any order, except that Missiles must always
be listed in groups of three, and Shells in groups of six.  Damage must
be taken on attributes in order starting from the far right and
proceeding leftwards.  Likewise damage must be repaired starting with
the leftmost (i.e. the most recent) damage on the sheet.  Missiles and
Shells are fired from left to right.

      EXAMPLE:  A Warpship with the attributes W2: PD=7 B=3 S=2 T=1 M=3
      E=2 could be arranged like so:

      W2: PBTMMMPEPSPBPBPSPE

      After taking three effective hits of damage, W2 would look like
      this:

      W2: PBTMMMPEPSPBPBP{SPE}

      The next attribute to take damage would be a P/D unit, then a Beam
      factor.  If W2 made it back to base in the above condition, the
      first attribute that would have to be repaired would be a Screen
      unit, then a Power unit,  then an ECM factor.

SECTION IV: TECH LEVELS

* 1. Tech increases one level every six turns.  Thus ships built in
turns 1-6 are tech level 1, those built during turns 7-12 are tech level
2, during 13-18 tech level 3, and so on.

2. Tech levels do not increase automatically for all weapon systems -
they must be bought in three separate types.  The three types of
technology are Energy, Guided and Kinetic.  Energy TL is applied to
Screens and Beams; Guided TL is applied to Missiles and ECM; and Kinetic
TL is applied to Shells and Armor.  Players are not required to develop
technology, nor are they required to develop all technology types
equally.  Each Tech Level costs 10 BP x level desired.  BP spent on
technology does not have to come from the same planet or be spent at the
same time.  BP spent on technology is cumulative.  Technology levels
never decrease.  Players may not gain more than one tech level per type
per turn.  Tech levels may be traded to other, allied players in a
multiplayer game, at a rate of one TL per one TL: e.g., a player may
trade offer his Kinetic TL 3 in return for Energy TL 2, both players
gaining no more than one level.  Technology may be stolen: a player
steals tech when he captures a star with a Base from a player with a
higher TL.  If the difference between the players' TL is only 1, the
capturing player gets 5 BP towards his next TL in all applicable types.
If the difference is 2, he gets 4 BP; if 3, he gets 3 BP and so on.
These BP may not be used in construction, only for TL.  Example: Player1
(TL: E:1 G:3 K:2) captures a star with a Base from Player2 (TL: E:3 G:1
K:3).  Player1 gets 4 BP towards E:2 and 5 BP towards K:3.

3. Screens subtract their TL from each separate hit, not from total
damage received.

      EXAMPLE: two beam 2 hits on a screen 3, both ships at equal TL:

      tech 0 ((2+0)  +  (2+0))  - (3 +0 +0)   = 1
      tech 2 ((2+2)  +  (2+2))  - (3 +2 +2)   = 1
      tech 5 ((2+5)  +  (2+5))  - (3 +5 +5)   = 1

      tech 5 vs tech 4, same weapon, shield mix 2x2 attacking, 3
      defending

      tech 5 firing vs tech 4
      ((2+5)  +  (2+5))  - (3 +4 +4)   =  3
      tech 4 firing vs tech 5
      ((2+4)  +  (2+4))  - (3 +5 +5)   = -1 (no damage)
      tech 1 firing vs tech 0
      ((2+1) + (2+1)) - (3 + 0 + 0) = 3
      tech 0 firing vs tech 1
      ((2+0) + (2+0)) - (3 + 1 + 1) = -1 (no damage)

4. Tech increases one level per tech type (as above) every two turns.
      Like so:

      Turn 3: Energy TL +1
      Turn 5: Guided TL +1
      Turn 7: Kinetic TL +1
      Turn 9: Energy TL +2
      Turn 11: Guided TL +2
      Turn 13: Kinetic TL +2

      and so on.

5.  For every tech level over 0, increase beam or screen effectiveness
by 1/3.  Thus, a 5-point beam at tech level 3 will do 10 points of
damage, and a 7-point screen at tech level 2 will absorb 35/3, or 12
points of damage (7 + 14/3 = 11 2/3 = 12 rounded up).

SECTION V: COMBAT

* 1. After 3 rounds of no combat, attacking Systemships are destroyed if
they cannot be picked up by retreating Warpships.

* 2. Warpships may pick up or drop as many Systemships per combat round
as they have Systemship Racks.  Each SR may EITHER pick up OR drop one
Systemship per combat round.

3. Ramming is a new combat tactic.  When ramming is selected, all energy
must be allotted to drive and no energy may be allotted to weapons sys-
tems.  For incoming fire, the ramming ship is regarded as using the at-
tack tactic.  All normal combat for the round is resolved and any damage
that the ramming ship takes is subtracted from its drive setting before
the collision.  The energy in the ship's drive is then applied as damage
against the enemy ship that is the target of the ramming.  The ramming
ship is automatically destroyed.  The drive differences between ships
are ignored.  It is assumed that ramming takes one by surprise and thus
can not be dodged.  Likewise the target ship's battle tactic has no ef-
fect.  If there is any energy in the drive the ramming will succeed.
Only one enemy ship can be rammed with each friendly ship.

4. Reserve Power Allocation:  As orders are written, a player may allo-
cate power factors to his 'reserves'.  This power may then be added to
the various ship systems to increase their effectiveness.  Reserve Power
may not be transferred to Beams or Tubes, nor to any system which does
not already have *some* power already allocated to it.  Power in re-
serves is released as follows: After combat tactics and weapons fire of
each ship is known (i.e., Attack & fire beam, or Dodge & fire missiles)
power may be transferred to screens.  After this, both sides reveal beam
strength, targets and drive allocations of their missiles (beam targets
are revealed before screens are increased), and initial drive alloca-
tions for ships.  Any power remaining in reserve may be used to change
that ship's drive setting, *either up or down.*  Combat is then resolved
in the normal manner, using the altered screen and drive values.

5. Hulks:  Any ship that is destroyed has its counter inverted, not re-
moved, to represent no energy output and warp generator shut-off.  An
inverted ship is considered adrift in combat, which means all attacks
hit with +1 damage.  An inverted ship (warpship or systemship) can be
picked up by a player's warpship as long so there are no enemy ships in
the same hex.  A player MAY pick up an opponent's inverted ship.  A
player may at any time voluntarily power-down any of his own ships
merely by inverting it.  While a ship is powered down it cannot move,
attack, and is treated as a destroyed ship, even to the point of being
scrappable by the opponent.  A player is not required to tell his oppo-
nent which ships are dead and which are powered-down.  A ship that is
powered-down for more than 3 turns is destroyed, due to death of crew
from unrecirculated air.  A powered-down ship may power-up at any time,
including while in another warpship's systemship rack.  The first combat
round after powering-up a ship's screens, beam and missiles are at half
strength.  If not carried by a warpship, drive is at zero.  If a ship
attacks the warpship carrying it, the warpship is always hit at +2.
Screens do not stop any hits in this case.  A warpship cannot attack any
ship it is carrying.  All it can do is take its lumps that round, eject
the ship, and attack next combat round.

EXTRA BONUS SCENARIO

WarpChess, or, Archon in Space

WarpWar is sort of like Archon, with simple strategic movement but
bloody tactical fighting.  So here is the variant to play WarpWar like
Archon.

First: Make a decent sized map.  One way to do this is to xerox (tm) the
original map twice and attach the two copies together side by side with
the ends facing opposite directions.

Next: Take a large number of BPs, say 200, and design a "set" of ships
to use.  Both players will use identical forces.  No systemships.

Set up the fleets in a uniform manner.  Flip a coin and go to it.  Each
player can only move 3 ships per turn.  Systemships, economics, tech
levels, and repair and resupply rules are not used.  Missiles and Shells
are automatically resupplied at the end of every player turn.  Game ends
when one side is destroyed; alternatively, both sides can designate a "king"
piece, the destruction of which ends the game.
