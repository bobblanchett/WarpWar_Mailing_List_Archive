Eldon Tannish & The War Of The Warp
by Dana Holm

     WarpWar is a beautiful little game.  It has several interesting
features - designing your own ships, simultaneous combat, and diceless
combat resolution.  However, the game suffers from being to evenly bal-
anced.  Whoever moves first has the advantage.
     To overcome this first move advantage, a scenario where no stellar
movement takes place has been designed.  This scenario also uses an un-
balanced initial force allotment with differing reinforcement rates
which is one cure for a symmetrical game.
     The idea for this scenario comes from the Eldon Tannish story in
THE SPACE GAMER #5.  Here, Eldon was defending a planet against attack.
This one game had no other players, only Eldon and the computer.  He was
given an allotment of resources to construct his defenses.  This was the
point that caused me to try the WarpWar game system.  There is a two
player version or a solitaire version, to be played against a paper com-
puter.  Like Eldon, you will lose!  The idea is to see how long you can
hold out.

TWO PLAYER VERSION - Eldon Tannish (Komal) vs. Computer (Kchul raiders)

I.  _Introduction_ - All ships used in this game are _systemships_.
    Eldon has been left by a warpship to protect this border world.  The
    Kchul ships are carried into the system and dropped beyond sensor
    range by two warpships acting like ferries.  The two warpships never
    appear in the game.  Since all action takes place at one star sys-
    tem, the map and counters are not needed.  They are useful as memory
    aids or for visual effect.  Watch Eldon quiver when you have 13
    ships against his one remaining defender.

II. The Game

    A. The game is played on two levels using two types of turns.
       1. The strategic level (strategic turn)
          a. All building, repairing, and resupply takes place at this
             time.
          b. No combat ever occurs during strategic turns.
          c. The game starts with a strategic turn.
          d. Every fifth turn thereafter is a strategic turn.
       2. The tactical turn (battle turn or tac turn)
          a. Combat takes place during battle turns.  No building ever
             does.
          b. There are four (4) battle turns between each strategic
             turn.
          c. Victory conditions are in terms of battle turns (see
             section V)

    B. Only strategic turns count toward the technological level rule.
       On strategic turn 5 (after 16 battle turns) the technological
       level goes up one as per regular WarpWar rules.

III. Player building point (BP) allotments

    A. Eldon Tannish (Komal)
       1. Initial allotment - 50 BP
       2. Reinforcement-repair-resupply allotment - 25 BP per strategic
          turn.
       3. Eldon may build things other than ships (See section IV)

    B. Computer (Kchul raiders)
       1. Initial allotment - 30 BP
       2. Reinforcement-repair-resupply allotment - 25 BP per strategic
          turn.
       3. Kchul raiders may build only ships.
       4. Kchul raiders must use each allotment as it arrives.  He may
          not save up BP's.  Any unused BP's at the end of a strategic
          turn are lost.
       5. The Kchul player does not have to commit his force to battle
          on the first turn.  He may enter any or all of his force at
          any time during the course of the battle, during a battle
          turn.
       6. Once a Kchul ship has entered, it stays until the end of the
          game.

IV. Special rules

    A. Eldon's ship restrictions
       1. Eldon may build ship(s) from his _initial_allotment_only.
       2. No BP's have to be spent on ships.  All BP's may be spent on
          ground defenses.

    B. Ground defenses - Eldon may build these with any allotment of
       BP's.  He may build either or both types.
       1. Ground energy projectors (GEP)
          a. GEP's cost 2 BP's for a one strength point unit.  (This
             reflects the gun and the power plant needed to operate it.
          b. GEP's may be built only in one strength point denomina-
             tions.
          c. As many of these one strength units as desired may be
             produced, within the amount of BP's available.
          d. It takes one missile or one beam hit to destroy a GEP.  Any
             extra force is wasted.  (Attacking with one ship firing a
             beam of 10 only destroys one GEP.  This is because of their
             geographical separation.)  Each GEP must be attacked
             separately.
          e. GEP's may combine attacks on enemy ships in any desired
             combination.
          f. GEP beams are assumed to have a speed of one (1) when
             attacking.
          g. GEP's use the attack tactic when firing, the retreat tactic
             when not firing.
          h. GEP's may not be attacked until: they have fired or until
             all friendly ships have been destroyed or have had their
             firepower destroyed.
       2. Ground launched missiles (GLM)
          a. GLM's are in all respects like spaceship launched missiles
             except that their maximum speed is six (6).  (The atmo-
             sphere slows them.)
          b. GLM's are purchased at the cost of 2 GLM for one BP.  (This
             includes the cost of launching apparatus)
          c. Because of their small size and easy-to-hide character-
             istics, GLM's may not be attacked from the air.  (Refer to
             victory conditions, section V.)

    C. Special uses of existing weapons
       1. Kchul raider attack against ground targets.
          a. When using missile attack, the ship may use any drive
             setting and any tactic.  The missile may be at any speed.
          b. When attacking with beams (since the attacker would have to
             enter the atmosphere to achieve accuracy) the attacker must
             use the attack tactic and can use drive settings of only 3
             or less.
       2. Eldon's technological gain - Starting on strategic turn five,
          if Eldon has any ships left, those ships gain the capability
          to absorb energy from GEP's.
          a. GEP's may be fired singly or in any combination at Eldon's
             ships, instead of firing at enemy ships.
          b. Instead of damaging Eldon's ships , the energy is absorbed
             and added to the current P/D or energy pool for the ship.
             It then acts in all ways like energy generated by the
             ships' engines.  It is possible to have a higher P/D than
             the ship was originally designed with.  This in no way
             harms the ship.
       3. Ramming (Optional rule) - The players should decide if both,
          neither or just one player can use this option.  This will
          change the play balance some.
          a. When ramming is selected as a tactic, no energy can be
             expended on beams, screens or launch tubes.  All energy
             must be allotted to drive.
          b. Ramming takes place after all fire for that turn has been
             resolved.  Also any damage that the ramming ship takes is
             subtracted from its drive setting before the collision.
          c. Only one enemy ship can be rammed with each friendly ship.
          d. The energy in the ship's drive is applied in one large
             explosion against the enemy ship that is the target of the
             ramming.
          e. The ramming ship is automatically destroyed.  (The drive
             differences between ships are ignored.  It is assumed that
             ramming takes one by surprise and thus can not be dodged.
             Likewise the target ship's battle tactic has no effect.  If
             there is any energy in the drive the ramming will succeed.)

V. Victory conditions

   A. It is best to play a set of two games.  Each players designs his
      starting force for both sides.  Then play a set of two games.  The
      person lasting longest as Eldon wins.  Eldon is finished (beaten)
      when all GEP's and all ship's firepower have been destroyed.
      GLM's may remain but they do not count as firepower.  If each
      Eldon player goes out on the same turn, the Kchul player with the
      largest BP total on the board would win.

   B. For those players wanting to play only one game - count the number
      of battle turns that Eldon lasts.
      1. 8 or less - You didn't make the finals.  In fact, how did you
         get this far? - Strategic Kchul victory
      2. 9 - 12 turns - No finals here either. - Decisive Kchul victory
      3. 13 - 16 turns - Tactical Kchul victory
      4. 17-20 turns - You made the finals!! - Moral victory for Eldon
      5. 21 - 24 turns - That humming you hear is the computer getting
         mad!
      6. 25-28 turns - You tied the record
      7. Longer than 28 turns - The computer must be broken!

SOLITAIRE VERSION - Eldon Tannish vs. Computer

I. This game is like the two player version with a few changes so the
   dumb computer has a chance.  It requires the use of a die to make
   decisions for the computer.

II. The changes

    A. The computer starts with twice the force he had in the basic two
       player version.  The computer's starting forces are: S4, S5, S8,
       and S13 (Refer to the computer's ship characteristics chart.)

    B. The computer must enter into battle, on battle turn one.  It may
       never hold back forces.  Its reinforcements come in as fast as
       they are generated.

    C. Sequence of play
       1. Enter computer's ships.
       2. List targets for Eldon's ships and ground defenses.  Allot P/D
          points.  PIck tactic.
       3. Use the computer target table to pick target for each of the
          computer's ships.  If Eldon had more than one ship roll a die
          to see which is attacked.
       4. Use the tactic table to decide what tactic each of the
          computer's ships is using.  Remember a beam ship attacking a
          ground target _must_ use the attack tactic.  If any ground
          attacks are made when there are no targets, the attack is
          wasted.
       5. Determine the setting of the ships' offensive weapons (beams
          or tubes) by rolling one die.  Any number in excess of number
          of offensive weapons is ignored.
       6. Determine the screen setting of ships carrying screens and not
          using missile by rolling one die.  Again ignore any excess die
          rolling.
       7. Any remaining energy is used for the drives.  If the drive/
          power does not contain enough energy to run offensive and
          defensive weapons, the defense suffers first until it is zero,
          then the offensive setting is reduced to the P/D setting.  Any
          ship with P/D = zero is considered destroyed.
       8. Resolve all attacks.  Damage does not take effect until all
          firing is finished.

    D. When the Kchul fires a missile, determine its speed by rolling
       one die.  That number is the missiles speed unless the number
       rolled is a one (1).  In that case, roll the die twice and add
       the two rolls together to get the missile's speed.

    E. The largest drive setting Eldon's ships can use during the game
       is _six_.

    F. Kchul resupply
       1. Each strategic turn the Kchul receives new ships and repair
          points according to the Kchul generation table.
       2. In addition, roll one die - the Kchul gets this number of
          additional repair points.
       3. Repair points are always distributed as evenly as possible.
          When in doubt, roll a die.
       4. All Kchul missile firing ships are automatically reloaded up
          to their original capacity.

RP = repair points

     C. KCHUL TARGET SELECTOR  -  roll one die

         1 - 5  attack a ship (when no ships remain, attack a ground
                unit)
           6    make an attack on a GEP (If there are none, the attack
                is wasted)

     D. KCHUL TACTIC SELECTOR  -  roll one die

         1 - 3  attack tactic
         4 - 6  dodge tactic (unless it is a beam ship on a ground
                              attack, in which case the attack tactic
                              must be used)

IV. PLAY AIDS - Of course you have to keep track of the damage levels of
the ships on both sides.  I find that making a set of tracks for each
side and using flipped over counters it is easy to see at a glance what
level each of the ship characteristics are at.  A second set of right
side up counters can be used to show what level each item is being used
at the current turn.  Actually, one set of tracks per side will work be-
cause Eldon usually doesn't have many ships and attacks can be resolved
one at a time.
